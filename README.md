# Alpine 7909 DC/DC converter
An improved DC/DC converter design for Alpine 7909.

Uses a Traco 6W converter to get symmetric +/-12V and then ultralow noise, ultrahigh PSRR linear regulators (LT3045, LT3094) to regulate the voltages down to +/-10V. 

The board is smaller than the original so should fit nicely into the space.

**Warning** The PCBs have not been tested as of now, use at your own risk.
